# Preimages
```{index} preimage
```

Let $f: X \to Y$ be a function between two sets. The  **preimage**  of a subset $S \subseteq Y$ under $f$,
written $f^{-1}(S)$, is defined by

```{math}

 f^{-1}(S) := \{x \in X \mid f(x) \in S\}
```

In other words,

```{math}

 x \in f^{-1}(S) \iff f(x) \in S

```
