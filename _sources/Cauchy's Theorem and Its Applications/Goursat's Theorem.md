# Goursat's Theorem

````{prf:theorem} Goursat's Theorem
:label: thm:4

 Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be an open set and $T \subseteq \Omega$ a triangle whose interior is also contained in $\Omega$.
 If $f$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$, then
 
```{math}
\int_{T} f(z) \dif z = 0
 
```

We could state and prove Goursat's Theorem
considering the counter integral along a rectangle.
But we will see in {prf:ref}`cor:1`
that the rectangle version is an immediate corollary of this triangle version
since we can divide a rectangle into two triangles.

````{prf:corollary} 
:label: cor:1

 If $f$ is holomorphic in an open set $\Omega$
 containing a rectangle $R$ and its interior, then
 
```{math}
\int_{R} f(z) \dif z = 0
 
```
